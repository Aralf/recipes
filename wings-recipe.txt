Ingredients:
 - 3 garlic cloves, crushed
 - 2 tbsp olive oil
 - 3 tbsp cider vinegar
 - 1 tbsp paprika
 - 1 tbsp Worcerstershire sauce
 - 2 tsp celery salt
 - 4 tbsp pepper sauce (Frank's hot sauce)
 - 3 tbsp honey
 - Couple of cracks of black pepper
 - 1.5 kg chicken wings

Directions:
 1. In a large bowl combine all ingredients. Add chicken wings and toss around
    to make sure they're full covered. If you have time, leave to marinade for
    a couple of hours.

 2. Heat oven to 180C, drain and reserve the marinade and then spread the wings
    out on a very large baking tray. Bake for 30 mins, then pour off the excess
    oil, turn around and add the reserved marinade and toss well. Increase to 
    200C for other 30 min.
